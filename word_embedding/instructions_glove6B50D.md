## Loading the Glove.6B.50D pretrained word embedding
Glove word embedding is word embedding representation, it incorporates global word co-occurrences statistics. Glove.6B is word vector is trained using Wikepedia 2014 and GigaWord5. Please follow the instructions given to download the glove6B.50D.txt word embedding file:

1. GloVe.6bzip word embedding can be downloaded from <a href = 'https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove'>https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/</a>.
2. Download glove.6b.zip under Download pretrained word embedding section.
3. extract glove.6b.zip, copy Glove.6b.50D.txt file inside word_emdding folder

### Note
You can use any pre-trained word embedding, I prefer glove.6b.50 word embedding as it was giving me good accuracy, and time taken to load the embedding is less compared to other pre-trained word embedding files
